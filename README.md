In this chapter, we will explain the use of more advanced geometries and meshes by dividing them into two subchapters.

## A. Advanced Geometries and Binary Operations

1. THREE.ConvexGeometry
2. THREE.LathexGeometry
3. THREE.ExtrudeGeometry
4. THREE.TubeGeometry
5. THREE.ShapeGeometry
6. THREE.ParametricGeometry
7. Creating and Rendering Text
8. Using Binary Operations to Combine Meshes

## A. Creating and Loading Advanced Meshes and Geometries

1. Geometry Grouping and Merging
2. Loading Geometries from External Resources
3. Saving and Loading THREE.Mesh
4. Saving and Loading a Scene
5. Working with Blender
